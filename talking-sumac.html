    <p class="date">February 2020</p>
    <p>Food is a second passion to me alongside design. I launched Talking Sumac to hold my recipes somewhere online allowing me to not only to share my love of cooking but also my recipes with family and friends.</p>

    <p>Sumac is one of my favourite spices and trying to play off of the phrase “Talking Smack” - I came up with Talking Sumac. I had a vague idea of where I wanted to take this brand but I thought it wise to bring in the natural colour palette of the Sumac berry which is where the vibrant red and rich green colour scheme comes into play.</p>

    <p>What is a good food blog without a recipe page? I deliberately designed these recipe pages to evoke the feeling of pieces of paper overlapping much like they do in my hand-written notebook where I jot down my recipes as I go.</p>

    <p>Alongside creating the recipes I also shoot all the food that goes into the collection. Talking Sumac is very much a work in development but one I hope to keep adding to over the course of the years to come.</p>
