    <p class="bold intro">Meet Clare who works in marketing and lives in Birmingham.</p>
    <p>Clare has recently found a two-bedroom apartment in the centre of Birmingham that she would like to buy.  She’s made an offer of £230,000 which has been accepted.</p>
    <p>Clare has saved up over the past 6 years and now has £25,000 towards her deposit.  She goes and speaks to her bank who offer her a mortgage of £207,000, which is 90% of the value of her home.</p>
    <p>Clare puts £23,000 from her savings towards buying the house which covers the remaining 10% that the bank doesn’t lend.  This leaves her with £2,000 for legal fees and money for the house-warming party.</p>

    <p class="bold">Clares's situation</p>
    <p>The best available interest rate that Clare can get from her bank with a 90% mortgage is 3.09%, which is fixed for a period of 5 years.  At the end of the 5 years most people re-mortgage and get a better rate as they have paid their mortgage down a bit and their house price might have increased too.</p>
    <p>With her 3.09% interest rate Clare would have monthly repayments of £991.  This repayment is made up of two things: the interest on the loan and the repayment of a portion of the loan each month.</p>
    <p>Over the course of the 5 years half the money Clare pays will be in interest and half will be repaying the loan.  That means her mortgage will have reduced to £177,000 in five years time.   She will have also paid interest of £30,000 to the bank.</p>

    <h2>How can Tembo save Clare money?</h2>
    <p class="bold intro">Clare needs to borrow £207,000 to buy her home.</p>
    <p>If Clare was to get some of this amount from her family, then she could save thousands of pounds in interest over 5 years.  She would also own more of her home when she comes to re-mortgage.  Win win.</p>
    <p>The problem is Clare’s family don’t just have a pile of cash ready to hand over.  But they do own their own home.  Through Tembo, Clare’s family could arrange for a small retirement interest only mortgage against their home.  They could arrange this through Tembo and take out £34,500 and put it towards Clare’s home purchase.</p>
    <p>This means that Clare’s mortgage is now only 75% of the value of the home, so the interest rates are much lower at around 1.75%.</p>

    <p>Over the next five years Clare will pay the same monthly amount of £991.  But at the end of the five years, she will have only paid £18,500 in interest, including the interest on her family’s interest only mortgage.  That is a pure saving in interest payments of £11,500 compared to the best alternative.</p>
    <p>Having paid down some mortgage and hopefully with a little increase in the value of her home Clare could then opt to re-mortgage. She might also decide to return the gift of £32,500 from her family too.  But by using Tembo, Clare will own £11,500 more of her home than if she went with her bank alone.</p>
    <p class="bold">More money for Clare, less money for the bank.</p>
